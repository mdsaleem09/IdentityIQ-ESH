  custom connectors.

SSD:

- Fixed issue with the Enhanced Email Notifier where it was not properly stripping spaces 
  from lists of email addresses, and provided extra examples.
- Fixed incorrect example in Password Expiration Reminder tool.
- Updated Performance Sizing Rule to work with later versions of IdentityIQ.
- Fixed issue with the Certification Closer iterator being closed before completion in 
  IdentityIQ 8.x.
- Certification Closer now ignores immutable items.
- A number of vulnerabilities have been fixed in various components in the SSD.


IMPORTANT: Ant is no longer provided with the SSD and must be supplied by the implementer.

- Latest version of Ant should be downloaded and made available in the path for execution 
	For Unix & Mac systems: 
		export ANT_HOME=<Location of ant> (eg: $HOME/build_tools/apache-ant-1.10.9)
		export PATH=$PATH:$ANT_HOME/bin

	For Windows Machines (SET is for current process space, to set the variables globally use syntax for SETX or use UI to set the variables)
		SET ANT_HOME=<Location of ant> (eg: D:\build_tools\apache-ant-1.10.9)
		SET PATH=%ANT_HOME%\bin;%PATH%
	
- If variables cannot be set, update the following lines
	build.sh (for unix machines) - ant $@  to <ANT_HOME>/bin/ant $@ (e.g.: $HOME/build_tools/apache-ant-1.10.9/bin/ant $@)
	build.bat (for windows machines) - ant %* to <ANT_HOME>\bin\ant %* (e.g.:  D:\build_tools\apache-ant-1.10.9\bin\ant %*)


The following SSB and SSD components have been removed:

- SSB Build Checks (will be replaced with a PS Extension plugin)
- SSB Document Generator / 'document' Ant target (new documentation tools are planned
  as PS Extensions)
- LogiPlex Connector (now available on on PS Extensions Page on Compass)
- IdentityIQ Loopback Connector (now part of the Accelerator Pack)
- IdentityIQ Summarizer (new documentation tools are planned as PS Extensions)
- Task Resulter Plugin (similar functionality available OOTB in Administrator Console)
- Customization Plugin (deprecated due to plugin enhancements in IdentityIQ 8.x versions)
- Log Level Manager Plugin (similar functionality available in DevSAK)
- Multithreaded BeanShell Toolkit (Java Multi Threaded Toolkit is planned as a PS 
  Extension)
- Rule Runner Task (similar functionality available OOTB)
- XML Object Exporter (Now available as a PS Extension in plugin format)
- Email Approvals (uses outdated POP and IMAT technology)
- Break Glass Access Request (available in Accelerator Pack and Rapid Setup)
- Server-Specific Task Launcher (similar functionality available OOTB)
- Certification Exclusion Framework (similar functionality now available in Targeted 
  Certifications)
- Access Request Attachments (similar functionality available OOTB)

Services Standard Frameworks and Features are still available in the SSD for customers using
these components.  SailPoint advises that new implementations should use Rapid Setup (8.1+) 
or the Accelerator Pack (8.0) instead.  The Features and Frameworks are likely to be dropped
from the SSD in a future release.
 
****************************************
NOTES
****************************************

JDK version 7 is no longer supported in the SSB/SSD.

To assist the SailPoint Support team, the version of the SSB or SSD used to build 
IdentityIQ can now be seen by accessing the ServicesStandardVersion.html file at the root
of the application (e.g. http://servername:8080/ServicesStandardVersion.html).  This
information is taken from these release notes, so please do not delete this file or move
it from its current location, and do not delete the html file that is generated during the
build process.  The page also includes a timestamp indicating the last time the build was
executed.

SSF provisioning now runs in the background by default for all the SSF features, which
means provisioning will not happen until the next time the Perform Maintenance task runs.
This is the recommended setting to avoid identity locking conflicts during identity 
refreshes.

If you are currently using a version of the SSF features and frameworks from SSD v1.1 or
earlier there is no simple upgrade procedure for these components.  An upgrade would be a
more in-depth exercise carried out by a trained and experienced IdentityIQ implementer.
