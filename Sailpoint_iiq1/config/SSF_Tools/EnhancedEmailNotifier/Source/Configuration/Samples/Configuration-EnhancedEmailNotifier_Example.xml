				dynamicEmailIdentityAttribute indicates the Identity attribute used
				to denote the post fix for an template name.
				
				e.g.
					o  The attribute is set to "country", which can have the values UK, GER, SPA etc
					o  The identity has the country set to UK
					o  When an email template is passed through this filter, the notifier class will
					   attempt to find the template name + "_UK", and if found it will use that 
					   email template

				The summary template Map, lists all the template names to

				The key of each entry  of the map indicates the Template name to
				process if encountered by this email notifier, and is referred to
				as the "Template Key".
				
				Each "Template Key" entry can optionally contain a list of instructions
				to render the the template data in the summary email template.  If
				no rendering instructions are specified, a default set of values
				will be generated and stored here when the Processor task is
				executed and processes the Email Template indicated by the
				"Template Key".
