<Rule language="beanshell" name="Plan SAP" type="BeforeProvisioning">
  <Description>An IdentityIQ server-side rule that is executed before the connector's provisioning method is called. This gives the customer the ability to customize or react to anything in the ProvisioningPlan BEFORE it is sent to the underlying connectors used in provisioning. 

This rule will be called for any application found in a plan that also has a configured 'beforeProvisioningRule' configured.  

The plan can be updated directly in the rule by reference and does not need to return the plan.</Description>
