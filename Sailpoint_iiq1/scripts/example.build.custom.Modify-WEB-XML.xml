	     in an upgrade-safe fashion.  The web.xml file gets patched during IIQ
		 patches and upgrades so we need to make modifications to it in a 
		 patching fashion where they don't risk overwriting new lines in the 
		 file or minimize the risk of doing so. 
		 We do this to support ACME's REST services.
